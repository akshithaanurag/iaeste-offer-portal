Admin Offer Portal – IAESTE Internship Platform (Frontend Prototype)

A responsive, frontend-only web platform for managing internship and job offers within the IAESTE ecosystem.

   Add new internship offers with PDF uploads, deadlines, and related details
   Members can apply for offers by uploading required documents
   Filter offers by country, department, and mode (remote, hybrid, on-site)
   NC Admins can upload and view Google Drive links for factsheets
   Clean and organized user interface with tab-based navigation
   Fully client-side; data is stored temporarily in the browser (non-persistent)

Tech Stack

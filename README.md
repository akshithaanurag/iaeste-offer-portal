Admin Offer Portal – IAESTE Internship Platform (Frontend Prototype)

A responsive, frontend-only web platform for managing internship and job offers within the IAESTE ecosystem.
Admins (LC/NC) can post internship opportunities, and members can view and apply for them directly through the browser.

Features
   Role-based login for Member, LC Admin, and NC Admin
   Add new internship offers with PDF uploads, deadlines, and related details
   Members can apply for offers by uploading required documents
   Filter offers by country, department, and mode (remote, hybrid, on-site)
   NC Admins can upload and view Google Drive links for factsheets
   Clean and organized user interface with tab-based navigation
   Fully client-side; data is stored temporarily in the browser (non-persistent)

Tech Stack
   HTML5 for semantic structure
   CSS3 for responsive design and animations
   Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic interaction
